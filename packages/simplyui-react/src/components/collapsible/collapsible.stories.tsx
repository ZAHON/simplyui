            From Bulbapedia: Bulbasaur is a small, quadrupedal Pok√©mon that has blue-green skin with darker patches. It
            has red eyes with white pupils, pointed, ear-like structures on top of its head, and a short, blunt snout
            with a wide mouth. A pair of small, pointed teeth are visible in the upper jaw when its mouth is open. Each
            of its thick legs ends with three sharp claws. On Bulbasaur's back is a green plant bulb, which is grown
            from a seed planted there at birth. The bulb also conceals two slender, tentacle-like vines and provides it
            with energy through photosynthesis as well as from the nutrient-rich seeds contained within.
